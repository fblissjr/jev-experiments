# typesafe-experiments

experimenting with jev inside claude code and agy and other harnesses

## Setup

```sh
bun install
```

### Tools outside npm

Experiment 09 also needs these, which `bun install` does not provide:

- The `duckdb` command-line tool. The label script calls it to read a warehouse.
- [ccutils](https://github.com/fblissjr/ccutils), which builds a DuckDB warehouse from Claude Code session logs. The results so far used ccutils commit `76533fc`.

Experiment 09's synthetic sessions and answer key come from [freudagent](https://github.com/fblissjr/freudagent), under `data/synthetic/`.

### Claude Code

These settings are needed for the parts that touch Jev or Claude Code:

- `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` for any arm that calls Jev. Arms that use a rule or a fake asker run without it.
- `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_FUNCTION_HOOKS=1` for anything that loads a hooks module into Claude Code. Function hooks are an early-access feature.

Keep both in `.env` (gitignored; Bun loads it) or in the shell, never in a committed file.

### Function-hook types

The code is typed against Claude Code's function-hook declarations. They are Anthropic's material, so they are not in this repository: generate them locally, and again after each Claude Code upgrade, before type-checking.

```sh
CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_FUNCTION_HOOKS=1 claude -p "/plugin-types"
```

The command writes `.claude/types/`, which is gitignored.

## Checks

```sh
bun test              # unit tests, on hand-made records only
bun run check         # type-check everything (needs the function-hook types above)
bun run check:hooks   # type-check src/compact/ as a hooks module sees it: no Node, no Bun
```

## Why TypeScript and Bun

A Claude Code hooks module is TypeScript, and it runs in an environment with no Node and no filesystem. The replay harness has to call the same decision code the hook will ship. Otherwise the experiments measure one thing and the hook runs another. So decision logic is pure TypeScript with the Jev call passed in: the harness passes one built on `@typesafe-ai/sdk`, and a hook passes one built on `$.http.fetch`. That code lives in `src/compact/`, and `bun run check:hooks` fails if it reaches for Node or Bun.

## Layout

```
docs/            dated records: landscape surveys, experiment results
experiments/     one folder per experiment, plus the protocol
src/compact/     hook-safe decision code: tool calls, protection rules, decisions, the Jev scorer
src/             harness code: session-log reader, compaction points, metrics, scorers for the arms, exchange units, labels and label scoring
tests/           unit tests
.claude/types/   function-hook declarations written by /plugin-types (local, gitignored)
internal/        unshared notes and session logs (gitignored)
runs/            raw experiment output (gitignored)
```
